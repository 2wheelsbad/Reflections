What happens when you initial a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The .git folder with meta data is created. This lets allows git to track the directory history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area acts a middle ground, between non-commited files currently being worked on and fully commited files. 
This all you to test files before fully adding them to the committed project.
