When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working with multiple people on a project, or you would like to keep a backup of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want to work on a new change that is not ready to be deployed to GitHub and wouldn't want Git to override these changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are specific to github and would only be used when cloning a directory form github.
Clones are used to copy an existing directory from github to your local machine or from another directory.
Branches are used to work on an experimental change in an existing directory without having to create a new directory.

What is the benefit of haivng a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This will allow you to work with the last known state without having to have a constant connection to GitHub
